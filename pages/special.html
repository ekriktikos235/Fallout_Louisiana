  <h2>CHARACTER CREATION</h2>
      <p>
        This chapter will guide you through creating your character so you can explore, scavenge, and survive, as well as
        how to level up to make sure you can handle anything the post-nuclear world might throw at you
      </p>

  <h2>S.P.E.C.I.A.L. ATTRIBUTES</h2>
      <p>
        Each character in Fallout is defined by seven attributes. They embody the character’s physical and mental abilities, compared to others, and define the ways
        your character prefers to approach problems.
        These attributes are Strength, Perception, Endurance,
        Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck. Each
        attribute has a rank, with higher numbers reflecting a
        greater ability. S.P.E.C.I.A.L. attributes can’t go below 4
        and can’t be increased beyond 10. Some creatures may
        have attributes higher or lower than this, or perks that
        increase their S.P.E.C.I.A.L. attributes above 10.
        Whenever you try to attempt a skill test, your
        S.P.E.C.I.A.L. attributes form one part of your target
        number when you roll your pool of d20s.

            you should be at the
            bottom. Luck gives you points to spend to add story
            details. Use your Luck attribute when you make skill
            tests, and re-roll dice.
